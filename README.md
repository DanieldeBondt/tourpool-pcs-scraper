# Tour pool

This project is used to scrape Procyclingstats for the latest Tour de France results. 
The stage results are used to compute points per rider per stage which is output as a csv file.
This overview can then be pasted into the Tour Game Excel sheet for a quick update of standings.

Credits to E.J. Poels for creating and hosting the original Excel-based Tour de France pool that this project is built to facilitate.

Please note that the html page of PCS could change in the future, and this scraper may not be accurate anymore. 

## Future development
* Refactor scraping to use [procyclingstats](https://github.com/themm1/procyclingstats) package.
* Add player's rider sheets and automate player rankings.
* Publish and automatically update results and rankings in a hosted dashboard.
